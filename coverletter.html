          <p>I am writing in regards to the Full Stack Web Development program at gSchool in Denver, CO.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p1">
          <p>I am very interested in attending gSchool through the Full Stack Web Development program. From my research on web development bootcamps and courses, it is evident that gSchool has an excellent course that stands out among the rest. I chose gSchool for the teaching style, the real life projects, and the connections Galvanize has throughout the community.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p2">
          <p>I believe I would be an excellent fit for the program as my skills are versatile and I am highly motivated to work in many areas of a project. I am a go-getter with a passion for creativity, problem-solving, and generating new ideas. I take pride and ownership in my work. I am incredibly organized, need little direction, and am focused on the combination of accuracy and efficiency. In any environment, I am continually trying to make improvements in processes, organization, and fluency.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p3">
          <p>I believe I have the motivation and the dedication needed to graduate from this program to the gSchool standards. I plan to use the skills and knowledge I obtain from this program to seek a challenging opportunity as a junior web developer and start a career in web development.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="closing">
          <p>I am excited about this opportunity and look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
