          <p>I am writing in regards to the Junior Software Engineer position at Brandwise in Lakewood, CO.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p1">
          <p>I am very interested in the position at Brandwise because I would love to be part of building something that matters. I admire Brandwise's commitment to creating business and sales solutions that not only aid in efficiency but also communication. I strongly desire to work in a fast-paced environment that is dedicated to creative problem solving.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p2">
          <p>I am currently a student in the Galvanize Full Stack program and will be finishing in a couple of weeks. I believe I would be an excellent fit for the position as my skills are versatile and I am highly motivated to work in many areas of a project. At Galvanize I have focused on the MEAN Stack and concentrated on becoming a well-rounded full stack developer. I am comfortable creating front end applications (using HTML, Ruby, Angular, jQuery, CSS and SASS) as well as building back end RESTful web services (using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL). I also have experience creating CRUD apps using Rails and Javascript. Recently, I have taken an interest in Ember and have been going to meetups in order to get a better handle on it. With that said, I am eager to continue learning and to contribute to real world projects.</p>
